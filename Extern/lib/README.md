python3.lib

	This is the version‑agnostic alias that most people use in their Visual Studio projects.

	It typically just redirects to whatever Python 3.x you’ve installed (e.g. it’s a copy or link to python313.lib).

	Recommended if you want to be able to upgrade to Python 3.14 or 3.15 in the future without changing your linker settings.

python313.lib

	This is the version‑specific import library for Python 3.13.

	You can link this directly if you know you’ll never move off 3.13, or if you need to be explicit.

	Functionally identical to python3.lib for Python 3.13—just less flexible.
